# BELLABEAT DATA ANALYTICS CASE STUDY USING PYTHON







## Overview


Welcome to my Bellabeat Data Analytics Case Study! ðŸš€ In this project, I've taken on the role of a junior data analyst, collaborating with Bellabeatâ€”a leading manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The journey involved addressing key business questions, and I've meticulously followed the data analysis process:

- **Ask:** Formulated relevant questions.
- **Prepare:** Cleaned and prepared the dataset.
- **Process:** Processed and organized data.
- **Analyze:** Conducted in-depth analysis.
- **Share:** Shared insights with the team.
- **Act:** Formulated actionable strategies.

## Second Phase: PREPARE Phase
  ### Dataset used:
 
   The data source used for our case study is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data. This dataset is stored in Kaggle and was made available through Mobius.

 ### Accessibility and privacy of data:

Verifying the metadata of our dataset we can confirm it is open-source. The owner has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission

### About Dataset


This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.



## Third Phase: PROCESS Phase


I choose to use python for my analysis considering the data sets are large and python makes it easier to visualize the data .



 **1. importing datasets**

```python
dailyActivity_merged=pd.read_csv(r"F:\dataanalytics project\Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16\dailyActivity_merged.csv")
dailyCalories_merged=pd.read_csv(r"F:\dataanalytics project\Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16\dailyCalories_merged.csv")

weightLogInfo_merged=pd.read_csv(r"F:\dataanalytics project\Fitabase Data 4.12.1
```

**2.Understanding Data Structures and cleaning**


```python
dataframes = [dailyActivity_merged, dailyCalories_merged, dailyIntensities_merged,
               dailySteps_merged, heartrate_seconds_merged, hourlyCalories_merged,
               hourlyIntensities_merged, hourlySteps_merged, minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged,
               minuteCaloriesWide_merged, minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged, minuteIntensitiesWide_merged,
               minuteMETsNarrow_merged, minuteSleep_merged, minuteStepsNarrow_merged,
               minuteStepsWide_merged, sleepDay_merged, weightLogInfo_merged]

for df in dataframes:
    print(df.info())
    print('\n' + '='*50 + '\n')  # Separating each DataFrame's info for better readability


for df in dataframes:
    df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
    df.dropna(inplace=True)

dataframes_to_verify = [dailyCalories_merged, dailyIntensities_merged, dailySteps_merged,
                        heartrate_seconds_merged, hourlyCalories_merged, hourlyIntensities_merged,
                        hourlySteps_merged, minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged, minuteCaloriesWide_merged,
                        minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged, minuteIntensitiesWide_merged, minuteMETsNarrow_merged,
                        minuteSleep_merged, minuteStepsNarrow_merged, minuteStepsWide_merged, sleepDay_merged,
                        weightLogInfo_merged]

for df in dataframes_to_verify:
    common_columns = set(dailyActivity_merged.columns) & set(df.columns)
    matching_ids = dailyActivity_merged['Id'].equals(df['Id'])
    
    if common_columns and matching_ids:
        print(f"Dataframe: {df}")
        print(f"Common Columns: {common_columns}")
        print(f"Matching IDs: {matching_ids}")

        common_columns_values = dailyActivity_merged[common_columns].equals(df[common_columns])
        print(f"Matching Data Values for Common Columns: {common_columns_values}")

        print(f"Sample rows from dailyActivity_merged:")
        print(dailyActivity_merged[common_columns].head())

        print(f"Sample rows from other_dataframe:")
        print(df[common_columns].head())
        print("="*50)


```


**note:**


**1.** Here date and time associated columns are also inconsistent . Actually we need to make them all consistent , but since the dataset is large it takes significant amount of time . so i will convert them when i am actually using those dataframes in the analysis . That way we donot need to parse all the dataframes and convert those values instead we modify some dataframes only when we need them 


**2.** The reason why we have compared Id and other columns of dailyActivity_Merged with others is some of the other Data frames are actually subsets of this dataframe . so we donot need to analyze all of them . so to check what other dataframes are subsets of this one we compared the ids and other columns .

## Analyzing the data 

##### 1.summarizing daily data


```python




        
# Selecting specific columns
selected_columns = ['TotalSteps', 'TotalDistance', 'SedentaryMinutes', 'Calories']

# Creating a subset of the dataframe with selected columns
subset_daily_activity = dailyActivity_merged[selected_columns]

# Using the describe method for summary statistics
summary_statistics = subset_daily_activity.describe()

# Displaying the summary statistics
print(summary_statistics)
print(sleepDay_merged.describe())
print(weightLogInfo_merged.describe())
print(heartrate_seconds_merged.describe())

```


output :  
```

```
**observations**


**1.**
The average total steps per day is 7637, close to the daily recommended amount of 7500 steps.

**2.**
Participants spend an average of 991 sedentary minutes per day (~17 hours).

**3.**
The average calorie burn is 2303 per day, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 4900.

**4.**
Participants, on average, have 1.12 sleep records and spend approximately 419 minutes asleep.

**5.**
Heart rate data shows an average value of 77.33.   which is good 

**6.**
Average weight of 62.5 kg.

##### 2. steps taken vs calorie burned 
From the above observations we can see that avg steps taken = 7637 and calorie burned = 2303 per day indicating there could be a positive correlation between them 

```

#2.verifying correlation between steps and calories burned



selected_columns = ['TotalSteps', 'Calories']
subset_dataframe = dailyActivity_merged[selected_columns].dropna()  # Drop rows with missing values
sns.regplot(x='TotalSteps', y='Calories', data=subset_dataframe)

# Adding labels and title
plt.title("Total Steps vs. Calories")
plt.xlabel("Total Steps")
plt.ylabel("Calories")
plt.legend()

# Display the plot
plt.show()

```
output : 



![stepsvscaloriescorr](https://github.com/Kedhar193/BellaBeat-DataAnalytics-casestudy-python-/assets/115712936/b77a704b-4429-4104-b84a-4447d76da4d0)


this indicates a positive correlation 


##### 3.Analyzing number of steps per weekday 

```python



dailyActivity_merged['ActivityDate'] = pd.to_datetime(dailyActivity_merged['ActivityDate'])

# Extracting day of the week and setting the order
dailyActivity_merged['weekday'] = dailyActivity_merged['ActivityDate'].dt.strftime('%A')
weekday_order = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
dailyActivity_merged['weekday'] = pd.Categorical(dailyActivity_merged['weekday'], categories=weekday_order, ordered=True)

# Grouping by weekday and calculating mean steps
weekday_steps = dailyActivity_merged.groupby('weekday')['TotalSteps'].mean().reset_index()

# Plotting the data
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='weekday', y='TotalSteps', data=weekday_steps, palette="viridis")

# Grouping by weekday and calculating mean sleep duration
weekday_sleep = sleepDay_merged.groupby('weekday')['TotalMinutesAsleep'].mean().reset_index()

# Plotting the data
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='weekday', y='TotalMinutesAsleep', data=weekday_sleep, palette="pastel")

##### 5.analyzing hourly intensities


```
hourlyIntensities_merged['ActivityHour'] = pd.to_datetime(hourlyIntensities_merged['ActivityHour'], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')

# Splitting into date and time
hourlyIntensities_merged['date'] = hourlyIntensities_merged['ActivityHour'].dt.date
hourlyIntensities_merged['time'] = hourlyIntensities_merged['ActivityHour'].dt.time

# Grouping by time and calculating mean total intensity
hourly_intensities = hourlyIntensities_merged.groupby('time').agg(mean_total_int=('TotalIntensity', 'mean')).reset_index()

##### 6.hourly steps through out the day 

```

if not hourlySteps_merged['ActivityHour'].empty:
    # Convert 'ActivityHour' to datetime format
    hourlySteps_merged['ActivityHour'] = pd.to_datetime(hourlySteps_merged['ActivityHour'], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')

### overall observations 


**1.** Users donot get recommended 8 hrs sleep 


**2.** Heart rate and weights are in recommended range . 


**3.** U are taking less number of steps and excercise on weekends .


**4.** Users are most active around 7-9 p.m .


**5.** Users are taking more number steps at this time too 7-9 p.m . This probably indicates that most of the active users are working class women and they do excercise after they are done with work at office .


### Suggestions (ACT phase)


**1.** It is proven that users are not getting recommended sleep . so product could give reminders and recommendations to get the recommended sleep .


**2.** Product could focus on motivating the users to work on weekends too since we can see that users are not working out enough on weekends as they do in other weekdays . 


**3.** It seems that most of the active users are working class women as per the hourly intensities data . So target audience for marketing will be working class women . So company needs to advertise on platforms where most working women engage or use .
